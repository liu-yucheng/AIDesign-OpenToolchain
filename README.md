## AIDesign-OpenToolChain-Introduction

AIDesign Open Toolchain is a collection of [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) AI research applications. These applications are all released under the GNU GPL3 license. These applications have the following primary functions.

1. Preprocessing AI training datasets
2. Creating, training, and tuning AI (GAN) models
3. Postprocessing AI training results

Currently, this toolchain consists of the following applications.

1. [AIDesign-Widgets](https://github.com/liu-yucheng/AIDesign-Widgets). Can be used for preprocessing AI training datasets.
2. [AIDesign-GAN](https://github.com/liu-yucheng/AIDesign-GAN). Can be used for creating, training, and tuning AI (GAN) models. Features my "Fair Predictive Alternating SGD" GAN training algorithm.
3. [AIDesign-Blend](https://github.com/liu-yucheng/AIDesign-Blend). Can be used for postprocessing AI training results.

## AIDesign开放工具链简介

AIDesign开放工具链是一个用于AI研究的[自由软件](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.zh-cn.html)应用合集。这些应用都是以GNU GPL3的许可证来发布。这些应用有以下主要功能。

1. 预处理人工智能模型的训练集
2. 创建、训练、和调试人工智能（对抗生成网络）模型
3. 对人工智能训练结果进行后期处理

目前，此工具链一共包含如下几个应用。

1. [AIDesign-Widgets](https://github.com/liu-yucheng/AIDesign-Widgets). 可用于预处理人工智能模型的训练集。
2. [AIDesign-GAN](https://github.com/liu-yucheng/AIDesign-GAN). 可用于创建、训练、和调试人工智能模型。推荐尝试我研发的“公平预测型交替梯度下降”对抗生成网络训练算法。
3. [AIDesign-Blend](https://github.com/liu-yucheng/AIDesign-Blend). 可用于对人工智能训练结果进行后期处理。

## Versions

### Versioning

```text
The versioning of this application collection is based on Semantic Versioning.
You can see the complete Semantic Versioning specification from
  https://semver.org/.
Basically, the version name of this application collection is in the form of:
  x.y.z
  Where x, y, and z are integers that are greater than or equal to 0.
  Where x, y, and z are separated by dots.
  x stands for the major version and indicates non-compatible major changes to
    the application collection.
  y stands for the minor version and indicates forward compatible minor
    changes to the application collection.
  z stands for the patch version and indicates bug fixes and patches to the
    application collection.
```

### Version Tags

```text
The version tags of this repository has the form of a letter "v" followed by a
  semantic version.
Given a semantic version:
  $x.$y.$z
  Where $x, $y, and $z are the semantic major, minor, and patch versions.
The corresponding version tag would be:
  v$x.$y.$z
The version tags are on the main branch.
```
